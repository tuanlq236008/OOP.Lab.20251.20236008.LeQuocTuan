1.Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for DVD. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?

The array parameter works the same internally, but varargs provide simpler syntax and better readability.
I prefer varargs in this case.

2. Is Java a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?

Java is Pass by Value.
Primitive types are passed by copying their value.

3. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), why do the titles of these two objects still remain the same?

Because Java is Pass by Value, not Pass by Reference.
The swap() method receives copies of the object references, not the original references.
Therefore, their titles remain unchanged.

4. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?

Both the original reference (jungleDVD) and the parameter reference inside the method point to the same DigitalVideoDisc object in memory.
Hence, the title of the jungleDVD is changed.

5. Write a toString() method for the DigitalVideoDisc class. What should be the return type of this method?

The return type of the toString() method should be String.
It returns a textual description of the object.
