1. Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they
initialize for their parts?
-> The class Media are aggregates of class Cart and Store. All the constructors of the classes will initialize for their parts.
2. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
-> The Comparable interface should be implemented by a class that we can define a natural ordering for its objects.
3. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that we want?
->To implement the compareTo() method correctly, we must define a consistent and logical ordering and return negative int (< 0) 
if the current object is less than the argument, zero (0) if objects are equal in ordering and positive int (> 0) if the current object is greater than the argument.
4. Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
-> No, the Comparable interface only allows one natural ordering (defined by the compareTo() method). If we need multiple sorting rules 
(e.g., "by title then cost" and "by cost then title"), we must use Comparator instead.
5. Question: Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. 
How would you modify your code to allow this?
-> In the definition of the DVD class, we can override the method compareTo() to allow ordering rule which is different from other media.
